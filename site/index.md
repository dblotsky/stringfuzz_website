        StringFuzz is an extensible fuzzer for automatically generating and transforming SMT-LIB string constraints (word equations, regular expressions, etc.), aimed at testing SMT string solvers. We are currently working on an evolutionary version of StringFuzz aimed at identifying performance issues in string solvers.

        The navigation bar has links to documentation, source code, and other relevant information.
